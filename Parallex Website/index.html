		<h2>Early Origins</h2>
		<p>
			The term "samurai" originally referred to servants or attendants in the imperial court during the Heian period (794–1185).
			Over time, these servants evolved into a class of warriors who played a crucial role in Japanese feudal society.
			Samurai underwent rigorous training in martial arts, archery, and horsemanship from a young age.
			Education also included learning literature, poetry, and tea ceremony, reflecting a well-rounded and cultured warrior.
			Samurai occupied the top tier of the social hierarchy in feudal Japan.
			Despite their elevated status, samurai were bound by a strict code of conduct and were expected to live modestly and with humility.
			It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

		<h2>Feudal Japan</h2>
		<p>
			The rise of the samurai class coincided with the decentralization of political power in Japan during the Kamakura period (1185–1333).
			Samurai served regional lords known as daimyos, who were engaged in constant power struggles.
			Samurai were known for their distinctive armor, which included the iconic helmet (kabuto) and body armor (yoroi).
			The katana, a curved, slender sword, was the primary weapon of the samurai and was considered a symbol of their social status.
			Samurai occupied the top tier of the social hierarchy in feudal Japan.
			Despite their elevated status, samurai were bound by a strict code of conduct and were expected to live modestly and with humility.

		<h2>Bushido Code</h2>
		<p>
			The samurai followed the Bushido code, a set of ethical principles emphasizing loyalty, honor, and self-discipline.
			Bushido influenced every aspect of a samurai's life, from the way they fought in battle to their conduct in everyday situations.
			The Tokugawa Shogunate (1603–1868) brought about an era of relative peace, known as the Edo period.
			With fewer opportunities for warfare, many samurai became bureaucrats or adopted other professions.
			In the late 19th century, Japan underwent a period of rapid modernization and Westernization.
			The Meiji Restoration in 1868 marked the end of the samurai era, as the traditional caste system was abolished.
			Despite the end of their political influence, the legacy of the samurai persists in Japanese culture.
			The image of the samurai is frequently romanticized and has become a symbol of Japan's historical martial tradition.
